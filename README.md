# SSRS-Dashboards
SSRS Dashboards for SQL Server

This PBIX is a sample tech demonstrator using SQL DMVs to graph CPU, Memory and Connections

Built using the PowerBI March 2018 Desktop version

The idea is to publish to the Power BI Reporting Server and seta Data Refresh schedule.

Since you CANNOT change the Data Source in the SSRS PBI Portal, you must open the PBIX and change the 

Server connection for all the visualization queries and republish for each server you wish to Monitor
