# SSRS-Dashboards
SSRS Dashboards for SQL Server

This PBIX is a sample tech demonstrator using SQL DMVs to graph CPU, Memory and Connections

Built using the PowerBI March 2018 Desktop version

The idea is to have one Dashboard per server.

Since you CANNOT change the Data Source of a published PBIX in the SSRS PBI Portal, you must 

Open the PBIX in Desktop and change the Server connection for all the visualization queries and republish it back to 

the report server, one for each server you wish to Monitor
